            <h1 style="background:skyblue">Winter</h1>
            <h2>This is the coldest season of the year</h2>
            <h3>This is one of the four temperate season of planet earth</h3>




            <p>Winder is very cold, in some countries it snow. The days are shorter and the nights are longer the peak
                time when
                winter is experienced the most is December and January.</p>
            <p>During winter chilly mornings gives you a different feeling of your environment.</p>
            <p>The sun rises quite late and sometimes it does not. Even when it does, it doesn't get a bit hot.</p>
            <p>However, not many people prefer going out during the winter depends on if your in a country that snow and
                has
                freezing temperature they prefer stay in the heater</p>
            <p>I am not a fan of the cold and the slippery and wet snow everywhere I don't really enjoy winter</p>

                <p>Autum which is also known as fall is a time for harvesting most crops.</p>
                <p>Deciduous trees lose their leaves,usually after turning yellow,red or brown. Autumn is a greatv time
                    to break out the jackets, coats,boots,scares and hat in preparation for the change in season</p>
                <p>Autumn is the "cooling off" month right between the blazing summer and chilling winter.</p>
                <p>Autumn is a great time to go fishing or take a road trip anthing that has to do with relax and
                    spending time with your family</p>
                <p>I like this time of the year i get to reunit with my family</p>
